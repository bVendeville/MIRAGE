## ðŸ§­ Overview

**Mirage** is a modular Python library for benchmarking factual consistency in natural language generation. It offers a standardized interface to load, evaluate, and visualize results across multiple classes of factuality metrics including:

- Classification-based (e.g., FactCC, TrueTeacher)
- QA/QG-based (e.g., QAGS, FEQA)
- Entity-based (e.g., FactAcc)

This library is designed for researchers and practitioners aiming to evaluate model outputs (e.g., summaries, translations, generated text) against reference/source texts for factual consistency.
